# TitleRotator
**Version:** 1.0
**Game Version:** Turtle WoW (Interface 11200)

TitleRotator rotates all your titles every few seconds. You can customize the settings by clicking the `Rotator` button in your character frame.
* Check `Enable` to enable rotation.
* Check `Disable in raids` to automatically stop rotating when you're in a raid.
* Use the up/down buttons to change the order of the titles.
* You can adjust the delay on each title. Setting it to 0 will take the title ouf of the rotation.

Due to the way the game handles setting your title the rotataion automatically stops when you open your character frame or any dropdown menu is open. When it stops, the 1st title in the list is used.

It will resume rotating once they are closed.
